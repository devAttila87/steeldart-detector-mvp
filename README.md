# Single Camera Steeldarts Automatic Score Detection MVP

[Example Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSVEU0BRPVY)

Achieving an overall 95%ish accuracy with the ongoing implementation is the goal. 
Once the MVP is robust enough, almost everyone with a free camera at 1080p will be able to use my MVP as an entirely free Steeldarts auto-scoring solution.

## Requirements: 
* at least 1080p static camera (smartphone camera might also work)
* camaera positioned at the dartboard in an angle from 50° up to 80°
* Java 17

This approach is inspired by Jacob D. Delaney`s EE368/CS232 project proposal.

Thanks for your interest.
